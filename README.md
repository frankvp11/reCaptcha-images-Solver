Basically, the main.py file is the main function that I made in python (way back when). It goes to the old reddit page, however before you can even see the recaptcha you have to fill in a bunch of garbage -> which is a bad example to test. Thus, I am changing it to these voting pages: https://mc-servers.com/vote/5023 and https://minecraft-server.net/vote/WickedPrison/ as they display them upon loading. What I am thinking of doing is creating a conditional that if there's a recaptcha on the page (verifiable by the recaptcha-checkbox-border tag, then I send the website URL to an API that I am going to make (in place of the main.py file) which basically does everything that the main.py file does ie, opens the webpage, listens to the audio, gets the transcription and gets the token returned by completing the captcha -> findable at document.querySelector('#g-recaptcha-response').value. Then return the key-value to the chrome extension, and set the document.querySelector('#g-recaptcha-response').value equal to the key.
